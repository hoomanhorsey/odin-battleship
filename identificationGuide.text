Your challenge is very common, especially in complex DOM-based projects like games. The confusion arises because the DOM provides multiple ways to identify and interact with elements, but each has its strengths and appropriate use cases. Establishing a clear methodology can significantly reduce confusion and improve maintainability.

Here are some best practices for structuring and managing DOM element identifiers:

1. Use IDs for Unique Identifiers
When to Use: Use id for elements that must be unique in the entire document, like a container for the game grid (<div id="game-board"></div>).
Advantages:
Fast and efficient for selection (document.getElementById()).
Ensures no duplicate usage.
Example:
<div id="ship-container"></div>
Tip: Avoid using id for dynamic or repeating elements like individual grid squares; those are better handled with other methods.

2. Use Classes for Reusable Styles and Behaviors
When to Use: Use class to define shared styles or behaviors across multiple elements, such as "occupied" or "highlighted" grid squares.
Advantages:
Can apply to multiple elements.
Easy to style with CSS and select with JavaScript (document.querySelectorAll(".classname")).
Semantically meaningful.
Example:
<div class="grid-square occupied"></div>
Tip: Use multiple classes to indicate states (e.g., highlighted, occupied) rather than dynamically changing IDs.

3. Use Data Attributes for Game-Specific Metadata
When to Use: Use data-* attributes to store custom information related to the game logic, like coordinates or ship presence.
Advantages:
Encapsulates game-specific metadata in the DOM without affecting styles.
Easy to access and manipulate with dataset (e.g., element.dataset.row).
Example:
<div class="grid-square" data-row="3" data-col="2" data-occupied="true"></div>
Tip: Data attributes are especially useful for dynamic data that changes during gameplay.

4. Use JavaScript for State Management
Avoid relying solely on the DOM for storing game state. Instead:

Keep the main game state (like ship positions) in a JavaScript object or array.
Use DOM attributes (e.g., data-*) for rendering and user interaction, but sync these with your JavaScript state.
Suggested Methodology for Battleship
Here’s a specific suggestion for organizing your DOM in a Battleship game:

Grid Squares

Use class to define general appearance and states ("grid-square", "highlighted", "occupied").
Use data-* attributes for logical metadata:
<div class="grid-square" data-row="0" data-col="0" data-ship-id="null"></div>
Ships

Use id for individual ships (e.g., <div id="destroyer"></div>).
Use class to define ship appearance and state ("ship", "selected", "rotated").
Use data-* to track ship properties:
<div id="destroyer" class="ship" data-length="3"></div>
Event Handling

Use classes for visual states (highlighted, valid-placement, invalid-placement).
Use data-* to link the DOM to game logic (e.g., data-row and data-col for coordinates).
Final Tips
Avoid Overloading the DOM: Store critical game logic in your JavaScript model, and let the DOM reflect only the necessary states.
Consistent Naming: Adopt a clear naming convention, e.g., class="grid-square highlighted" or id="ship-container".
Separation of Concerns: Avoid mixing styling and logic in the same identifier (e.g., don’t name a class ship-horizontal if it’s also being used to check orientation in JavaScript).
Document Your Decisions: Write comments or a simple guide explaining how classes, IDs, and data-* attributes are used in your project.
