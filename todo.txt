*** targetListener
It's active while player is picking object. May need to trigger after set up.

- Make 'computer move' text appear more gradually

- review classes in display.js, some may be redundant

- gameInit includes a position preffill, but this will need to be replaced with a playerPosition, and computer random position.  It will draw in tools from gameObjects. Probably oaky to include in init

***place user ships position
user current drags ship shape onto gameBoard
- need to drag ship shape onto grid square, rather than the board.
    - you will need to create an event listener FOR EACH, as well as prepare a remove event listener

    - when you drag the shape you want it to be a shape with a dotted border.
        + can't make dotted border yet as conflict with base grid square attributes, but filled background in as pink
    - you may also wish to highlight the area that is the main part of the shipBlock
    - you may also wish to make the grid squares that intersect with the shipblock glow or do some kind of brief animation.

- ship shape has a ID, which refers to the ship type.
- once you place it on the grid Square you can then update the DOM to display, but only provisionally. You don't want to save it to the array just yet.
    - you want to check if it's illegal and if there are collisions - make the gameBoard flash red if it is illegal or there is a collisons
    - you want to use a mouse scroll or up and down keys to cycle through positions
    - you can use rotate() to do this apparently.
        + I have configured mouse scoll wheel to rotate, but only once, and before it is dragged
- create a button that confirms where you want to place the ships?
- ideally just plopping them down on the grid square should allow you to update the array. If you move it though you can then update the array to change it. 

- Then create a button that confirms that positions are finalised.
    - this button is only highlighted or active once all 5 ships have been placed.

- Then after that the computers move is initiated.








DONE (Somewhat, may need to review)

// CONSOLIDATING PLAYER VARIABLES
- think about player variables, make consistent perhaps get ride of attacking player/defending player. But think about making it two player and how this will affect that first.

- targetListener takes attackingPlayer and defendingPlayer as args, but only uses defendingPlayer
- attackListener takes attackingPlayer, defendingPlayer and players as variables.
