// CONSOLIDATING PLAYER VARIABLES
- think about player variables, make consistent perhaps get ride of attacking player/defending player. But think about making it two player and how this will affect that first.

- targetListener takes attackingPlayer and defendingPlayer as args, but only uses defendingPlayer
- attackListener takes attackingPlayer, defendingPlayer and players as variables. 



- Make 'computer move' text appear more gradually

- review classes in display.js, some may be redundant

- gameInit includes a position preffill, but this will need to be replaced with a playerPosition, and computer random position.  It will draw in tools from gameObjects. Probably oaky to include in init
